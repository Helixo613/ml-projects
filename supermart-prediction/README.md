#  Supermart Sales Prediction

This project focuses on predicting sales and profit performance in a retail dataset. It uses exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and machine learning models to understand the relationship between features like product category, discount, and regional performance.

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset from a fictional superstore, the goal is to predict:
- Sales (`Sales`)
- Profit (`Profit`)

using other categorical and numerical features in the dataset.
